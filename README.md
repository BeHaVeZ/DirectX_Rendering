# DirectX Rendering <br>
## üéÆ CS(AK) Render <br>
A DirectX rendering project showcasing realistic 3D modeling and rendering techniques.<br>
This project renders a CS model in a window with dynamic lighting, shading, and texture mapping.<br>
Users can explore the scene with camera controls (WASD), while the model rotates. The project also implements post-processing effects like anti-aliasing for enhanced visual quality (F2). <br>

## Usage Instructions:
#### 1:
To run this project, ensure you have the following:
* Visual Studio: You'll need Visual Studio installed to compile and run the project.
* DirectX SDK: Make sure you have the DirectX SDK installed in your development environment.
#### 2:
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:<br>
```git clone https://github.com/BeHaVeZ/DirectX_Rendering.git```
#### 3:
Open the Solution: Navigate to the DirectX/source/ directory and open the DirectX.sln file in Visual Studio.
#### 4:
Choose Configuration: Select your desired build configuration (e.g., Debug or Release) from the top toolbar in Visual Studio.
#### 5:
Build the Project: Click on the "Build" menu and select "Build Solution" or use the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + B.
#### 6:
Run the Application: Once the build is successful, the executable will be located in the DirectX/bin/ folder. Run the executable to launch the application.


## Controls:
* F2 Key: Cycle through post-processing effects.
* F5 Key: Stop rotation of the model.
* Right Mouse Button + Move: Look around in the scene.
* WASD Keys: Move around the scene.

These controls will help you navigate and interact with the application. Once the program is running, use these keys and mouse actions to explore the rendered scene and adjust visual effects.
