# DirectX Rendering <br>
## 🎮 CS(AK) Render <br>
A DirectX rendering project showcasing realistic 3D modeling and rendering techniques.<br>
This project renders a CS model in a window with dynamic lighting, shading, and texture mapping.<br>
Users can explore the scene with camera controls (WASD), while the model rotates. The project also implements post-processing effects like anti-aliasing for enhanced visual quality (F2). <br>
